# WebFireWall-Application
Welcome to my Web Application Firewall (WAF) Demo! This is a beginner-friendly tool designed to help you learn about firewall rules and how to apply them to protect your web applications from malicious requests.

The WAF Demo is open-source and free to use, so you can access the code and experiment with the firewall rules to your heart's content. You can use this demo to gain hands-on experience with configuring firewall rules to block SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, and other types of malicious requests.

To get started, simply clone this repository and run the Python script. You can then visit the demo website and test different types of requests to see how the firewall rules work.

I hope you find this tool useful in your journey to learn about web application security and firewall rules.
